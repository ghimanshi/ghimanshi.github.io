            <p>It takes a hell of courage to write out all that’s there on your mind. To expose all those sides, no matter how happy or vulnerable, for the world to see, despite all the numerous voices in your mind, trying their best to make you believe how the world will judge you. For, to write it all out,  you first have to confront what’s there on your mind. You have to revisit those moments whose mere thought is enough to make you squint your eyes and clench your fists while sweat keeps dripping out of your body as if you are standing under the scorching sun and your breathing rate is as high as an athlete who has just finished a marathon. You also get to revisit those moments where you felt in seventh heaven because of things that the world around you won’t give a minute’s importance to. And, you revisit the times when you felt no other emotion but only numbness. When you wanted to cry your eyes out but the only thing that you could do was to just stand and revisit the same set of thoughts, again and again. How do you write about moments when you felt nothing but just numb? How do you share the best parts of your life knowing that the world is going to spoil them for you? How do you write about your worst fears knowing that the world is going to make them even worse for you? So, are those people who write about all of these maniacs? Don’t they ever feel a slight ache in their heart and truckloads of anxiety when they write and share a part of them with the world? Neither are they maniacs nor is it like they don’t feel pain and fear while putting a part of their life out there for the world to see. They write because they know the pain, fear, anxiety, and all such emotions that one faces in one such situation. They just choose to put them out there because maybe, another human is going through the same circumstances and feeling the same pain, and probably the acknowledgment that they aren’t alone in this will make them feel a tad bit better? For, you don’t know the real pain until you’ve experienced it. So, just know, it takes a hell of courage to be a writer. Writers are not just yet another class of human beings who happen to write relatively more than the rest of the population. They’re someone who tries to be there for people going through what they, themselves have been through.
